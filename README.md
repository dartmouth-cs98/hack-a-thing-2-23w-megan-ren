# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I wanted to build a (very, very, very) basic web browser using Electron. I spent a lot of time getting up to speed with how Electron communicates between processes. The final product is a barebones browser with a URL bar that can be used to navigate between websites and utility buttons like back, forward, and refresh. 

Include some screenshots.

## What you learned

I learned a lot about the architecture behind Electron's framework - like how to send messages between processes, how to combine HTML with certain scripts, and how to use Electron's custom objects like BrowserWindow and BrowserView. I'm glad I was able to put together a semi-functioning product with no clear tutorial out there - it seems like there isn't a huge dev community working on Electron projects and/or the documentation is a bit sparse. I worked for a long time on getting a tab functionality working, but ultimately couldn't get the message-sending to work properly for this specific task.

Just me.
